= Creating a migration plan

You can create a migration plan by using the {project-short} web console.

A migration plan allows you to group virtual machines that should be migrated together or with the same migration parameters, for example, a percentage of the members of a cluster or a complete application.

.Prerequisites

* You must create a VDDK image and add it to the `v2v-vmware` config map.
* You must add a source provider to the web console.
* If the target provider is not the {virt} cluster on which you installed {project-short}, you must add a target provider.
* For warm migration, you must enable link:https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/1020128[changed block tracking] on the virtual machines and on the virtual machine disks.

.Procedure

. In the web console, navigate to *Migration plans* and click *Create migration plan*.
. Complete the following fields:

* *Plan name*: Enter a migration plan name to display in the migration plan list.
* *Plan description*: Optional. Brief description of the migration plan.
* *Source provider*: Select a source provider.
* *Target provider*: Select a target provider.
* *Target namespace*: You can type to search for an existing target namespace or create a new namespace.
* You can change the migration transfer network for this plan by clicking *Select a different network*, selecting a network from the list, and clicking *Select*.
+
If you defined a migration transfer network for the {virt} provider and if the network is in the target namespace, that network is the default network for all migration plans. Otherwise, the `pod` network is used.

. Click *Next*.
. Click *By clusters and hosts* or *By folders*, select clusters, hosts, or folders to filter the VMs, and then click *Next*.
. Select the VMs to migrate and click *Next*.
. Select an existing network mapping or create a new network mapping.
. If you select *Create a new network mapping*, select a target network for each source network.
. Optional. If you want to save the network mapping, select *Save mapping to use again* and enter a network mapping name.
. Click *Next*.
. Select an existing storage mapping or create a new storage mapping.
. If you select *Create a new storage mapping*, select a target storage class for each source data store.
. Optional. If you want to save the storage mapping, select *Save mapping to use again* and enter a storage mapping name.
. Click *Next*.

. Select *Cold migration* or *Warm migration* and click *Next*.
* Cold migration: The source VMs are stopped while the data is copied.
* Warm migration: The source VMs run while the data is copied incrementally. Later, you will run the cutover, which stops the VMs and copies the remaining VM data and metadata.

. Review your migration plan and click *Finish*.
+
The migration plan is saved in the migration plan list.
